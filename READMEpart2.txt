README- Part 2
There are a couple of problems that I noticed in the submition of the original project that have no effect on the project itsef.
Nevertheless, I thought it was a good idea to point them out, so that you can overlook them when analyzing my submition.
The first one is that usTestFile.txt has a slight error, so you may want to use your own file if you want to see accurate results.
Second, in MapMaker/MapMaker/src/backtracking folder there are two .class files that are of no use.
They are the same files that I made a semester ago when I attempted to do the same project.
They are just there because I used that project as foundation to start this one.
Lastly, I did not dare to edit either mistakes because I was affraid that it would be registered as the last edit on that folder given that I did submit at the last second.
